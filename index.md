summary: The XERO Viewer Client API uses a URL-based syntax to communicate with XERO Viewer. The requests made to the API return a XERO Viewer user interface in the target web interface. Typically, this API interfaces with an EMR system.

XERO Viewer is designed to be embedded in an Electronic Medical Record (<a href="#" data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.glossary.EMR}}">EMR</a>) system to allow images to be part of the complete patient record. 



This <a href="#" data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.glossary.API}}">API</a> describes how you can embed XERO Viewer into your own EMR or launch XERO Viewer in a separate browser window.


#### Intended audience

The XERO Viewer Client API is designed for integrators and web developers with experience and knowledge of managing web applications. Working knowledge of XML and web services is not necessarily required for the XERO Viewer Client API.
